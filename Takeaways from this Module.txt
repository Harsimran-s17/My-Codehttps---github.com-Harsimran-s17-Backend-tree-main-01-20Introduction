// node filename.js ------> is terminal command to run the code


//Node.Js is javascript runtime. It has two main features as described below:
//          1. It makes javascript code run on any computer whereas javascript code can only be executed on browser
//          2. It also provide additional methods such as interaction with files on computer etc.

// Node.js uses V8 engine  to get executed
// It is used on server to interact  with database and or to provide more security as code written on server is not accesible by client.
// Unlike php it does not require any additional tool to listen the requests, Node.js writes the server and listen to the incoming requests.


//EXECUTION OF NODE code    
        1. Using REPL
            REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
            In this method we open our terminal and then execute a command Node
            then we executes commands one by one 
            ex. > 2+ 2 
                > 4 (output)
            
        2. Second way is by creating files
            In this method we create a file with .js extension and then execute the files
            It is used for real apps
